        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p> This brisket chili is a bold, smoky twist on a cold-weather favorite. 
            Instead of the usual ground beef, it features slow-cooked, tender chunks of brisket that melt in your mouth and bring a deep, 
            meaty richness to every bite. The chili simmers with fire-roasted tomatoes, hearty beans, 
            and a blend of spices like cumin, smoked paprika, and a touch of chipotle for heat. 
            The result is a thick, flavorful stew with just the right balance of spice, sweetness, and smokiness.</p>

        <p> Perfect for game day, potlucks, or a cozy dinner, this brisket chili is even better the next day as the flavors continue to develop. 
            Top it with sharp cheddar, a dollop of sour cream, or fresh cilantro, and serve it with cornbread or crusty bread on the side. 
            <em>It’s a satisfying, comforting dish that elevates classic chili into something truly memorable.</em></p>

            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 can (28 oz) fire-roasted diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cans (15 oz each) kidney beans, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>1 can (15 oz) black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>2 tbsp chili powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
            <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp chipotle powder (optional)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 bell pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the brisket cubes and brown on all sides. Remove and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the onion and bell pepper to the pot. Sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
            <li>Stir in the chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, chipotle powder, and oregano. Cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the browned brisket back to the pot, along with the fire-roasted tomatoes, kidney beans, black lsbeans, beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 2-3 hours, or until the brisket is tender and the flavors have melded.</li>
            <li>Adjust seasoning to taste. If the chili is too thick, add more beef broth or water to reach your desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Serve hot, topped with shredded cheese, sour cream, or fresh cilantro if desired.</li>
            <li>Pair with cornbread or crusty bread for a complete meal.</li>
