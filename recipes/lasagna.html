        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This beef shin lasagna is a rich and deeply flavorful twist on the classic Italian dish. 
            Slow-cooked beef shin is braised until it’s fall-apart tender, then shredded and layered with a deeply savory tomato and red wine sauce. 
            The long cooking time allows the collagen in the beef to melt into the sauce, giving it a luxurious, 
            velvety texture that sets it apart from traditional ground beef versions.</p>

        <p>Each layer is built with silky béchamel, sheets of pasta, and generous spoonfuls of the slow-cooked beef ragù. 
            After baking, the top becomes golden and bubbling, with crisped edges and gooey melted cheese. 
            <em>It’s the kind of comforting, hearty meal that’s perfect for a slow Sunday or a special occasion — one bite and you’ll know it was worth the wait.</em></p>
