Hi, I can't believe I've made it this far into the Odin Project! All things going well so far. 

For this project, I am going to be creating a basic recipes website.

I'll check back in with this later as I want to reflect on how the project goes... see you soon! 

Update: It went really well! It took me one class to make this (about 4 hours!!)
